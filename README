Various scripts written for various things in the Media Design Practices department at Art Center College of Design.

Currently contains a simple 'time-lapse maker,' written to document the Thesis students installation progress. Will likely include various other things written for workshops or classes.

Note: This repo is a package of unrelated scripts divided into directories by the language each is written in.
